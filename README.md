### Getting started

You can use `npm` to install the dependencies and run the basic React project.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Playlist data

The playlist data is stored in `src/data/playlists.json`. It includes a list of audio files and some associated metadata,
you can import the json file directly with no need for network requests.

### Note to Reviewer

The audio player requires an initial click to load metadata before playback controls become fully functional. After this first interaction, all subsequent clicks will operate the audio player as expected. This two-step process is a known limitation in the current implementation that I plan to address in future iterations by enabling immediate playback without the initial click.
